title: Studio Clean - Static Website Development
description: For this project, I developed a static website for "Studio Clean," a fictional creative agency, using Eleventy as the Static Site Generator. The task involved analyzing a provided design to identify layouts and components, and then implementing them following the DRY principle and BEM naming conventions. Additionally, I used PostCSS to minify the code before deployment, ensuring optimized performance.
