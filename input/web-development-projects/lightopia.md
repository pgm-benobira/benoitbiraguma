title: Lightopia - Website Simulation
description: In this project, I was tasked with independently developing a responsive website based on a simplified version of the Lightopia Brussels design. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I recreated key pages, including interactive elements like dynamic map pointers and an FAQ section. I focused on clean, semantic HTML structure, optimized image assets, and a fully responsive layout. The JavaScript implementation included dynamically loading content and ensuring robust, modular code through the use of IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).
