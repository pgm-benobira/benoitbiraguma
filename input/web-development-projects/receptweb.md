title: ReceptWeb - Recipe Management Application
description: In this project, I developed a full-stack recipe management application featuring a user-friendly interface for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting recipes. The frontend was built with HTML, CSS (using PicoCSS for styling), and JavaScript, while the backend was implemented with Node.js and Express. I integrated both ends to support full CRUD operations, ensuring seamless interaction between the user interface and the backend. Additionally, I included a search function, category filtering, and a theme switcher for dark/light mode.
