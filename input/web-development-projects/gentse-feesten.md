title: Gentse Feesten - Website Simulation
description: This project aimed to simulate a real-world work environment where I was tasked with building a responsive website based on the actual design from 'Gentse Feesten 2023'. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the site independently. The project involved dynamically loading data via APIs, implementing interactive features like event filters and search functionality, and ensuring a responsive design across all pages. I also focused on clean code practices, such as using modular JavaScript files and optimizing assets for web performance.
