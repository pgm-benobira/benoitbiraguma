title: ColorQuest - Coding Motivation Tool
description: For this project, we created "ColorQuest," an interactive game designed to motivate beginners to learn coding. Targeted at students with no prior coding knowledge, ColorQuest challenges users to find the correct combination of three colors from a set of five to create a specific potion color. The project includes a detailed, step-by-step tutorial hosted on a visually appealing static website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tutorial guides users through the process of recreating the game, with code snippets and clear instructions.
