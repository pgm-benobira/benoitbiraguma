title: Studentvolgsysteem - Monitoring Application
description: In this project, me and three other students developed a comprehensive web application designed to track student progress throughout their academic journey. The system is used by various roles, including administrators, teachers, coaches, and mentors, to monitor student attendance, participation, performance, and overall status within the program. The backend was built using Express, PostgreSQL, and Handlebars for templating, with Knex and Objection for database management. The frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and modular JavaScript, supports a fully functional API to handle all post-login operations. The application also supports work-based learning tracking through various modules, ensuring a comprehensive approach to student development and performance analysis.
